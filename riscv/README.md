RISC-V is a 5 stage in-order pipeline processor with a 32-bit RISC-V ISA. The processor supports the following features:
- Predefined Constants
- ALU Operations
- Memory mapped I/O
- CSR support for basic system operations
- Pipeline stages: 
	- Fetch(IF)
	- Decode(ID)
	- Execute(EX)
	- Memory(MEM)
	- Writeback(WB)

- NO branch prediction
- NO hazard detection
- NO forwarding
